But if you want to claim 80% of your development time and start building simplicity and beauty one app at a time, you can use Ignite UI along the [WYSIWYG drag & drop App Builderâ„¢](https://www.infragistics.com/products/appbuilder). The low-code tool streamlines everything from design to code, letting you use a full UI toolbox to start a new project from scratch, choose from prebuilt templates, screens and starter layouts, or integrate Sketch and Adobe XD files (soon Figma) and turn them to production-ready Angular & Blazor code (Web Components and React next) with a single click.
