Ignite UI is the most comprehensive UI library with hundreds of enterprise-grade UI controls and components for every major framework. It is your way for building better web apps in [Angular](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular), [Blazor](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-blazor), [Web Components](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-web-components), [React](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-react), [jQuery](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-jquery), [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-aspnet-mvc), and [ASP.NET Core](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-aspnet-core). 

 * It packs hundreds of UI components for every major web framework. 
 * Delivers the fastest data grids on the market with all the features a developer needs. 
 * Provides 65+ high-performant, customizable charts and series types. 
 * With tons of visualization options available, you can handle voluminous, real-time business, financial/stock, scientific and/or industry data in an instant. 
 * Also included UI controls that your users will love, like Spreadsheet, Excel Library, Pivot Grid, Hierarchical Grid and even a DockManager - a complete desktop-like windowing UX. 

But if you want to claim 80% of your development time and start building simplicity and beauty one app at a time, you can use Ignite UI along the [WYSIWYG drag & drop App Builder™](https://www.appbuilder.dev/). The low-code tool streamlines everything from design to code, letting you use a full UI toolbox to start a new project from scratch, choose from prebuilt templates, screens and starter layouts, or integrate Sketch and Adobe XD files (soon Figma) and turn them to production-ready Angular & Blazor code (Web Components and React next) with a single click.
